ickmull is a framework for development of a general-purpose xhtml-to-icml transform.

# Introduction #

ICML is the simplest version of Adobe's new (as of CS4) IDML language, which is a representation of an InDesign document in open XML. ICML is just the 'story' part, leaving things like master pages, flows, typographic and layout styles, colour definitions, etc. out -- these can reside an an InDesign template easily enough. ICML is actually the CS4 file format for Adobe's InCopy distributed editing software.

What ickmull provides is the ability to use the Web instead of InCopy. So you can flow web content into existing InDesign layouts, in seconds.
