InCopy is InDesign's distributed-editing satellite tool. It allows editors to prep 'stories' for inclusion in an InDesign layout. InCopy's native file format (since CS4) is .icml, an XML-based format that is a nice subset of the much larger .idml

Ickmull creates .icml files. That's why it's called that.
