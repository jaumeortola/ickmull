#Wordpress used as a defacto reference standard for XHTML

# Introduction #

We've used WordPress and its excellent TinyMCE editor as a way of constraining the universe of possibilities that is XHTML. Rather than make Ickmull hugely complex in order to handle every conceivable variation, we designed it to work with WordPress-generated XHTML.

If you need something to behave differently, it won't be hard to add.
